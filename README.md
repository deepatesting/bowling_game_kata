💻 Test-Driven Development - Bowling Game Kata 💻

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

🤔 What is a kata?

🥋A Kata in martial arts means “a system of individual training exercises”. Just like in martial arts, coding also requires consistent practise to hone in the skill. As you move through the interview stages of the programme, you will most likely be sent tech tasks and/or coding “Katas" to complete for your take-home/live interviews. Test-Driven Development (TDD) is a sought after skill as an engineer in the tech industry, as it can help you write testable and clean code through a test-first approach. We call this ‘test-driving’ a program.

🗒️ Instructions

👉 Read the Bowling Game Kata requirements. You can find it in the following link: https://codingdojo.org/kata/Bowling/

👉 Please note that the kata ‘clues’ section refers to some C# testing frameworks like XUnit, please ignore these.

👉 Solve the Bowling Game kata in Java programming language.

🗒️ Solution

I considered below types of scoring in frames,
1. Valid values in one/all frames.
2. 'Miss' with values/no values.
3. 'Spare' with values and all spares.
4. 'Strike' with values.

First, I started adding the simplest test of checking the score for one roll.
Continued adding more tests to check for two rolls and then all frames with values.
I continued my testing game to check for 'miss' and then added more test cases for 'spare' and later
I tested 'strike' with few test cases.
Please check the commits to see how was the TDD process.
