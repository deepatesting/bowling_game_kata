💻 Test-Driven Development - Bowling Game Kata 💻

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

🤔 What is a kata?

🥋A Kata in martial arts means “a system of individual training exercises”. Just like in martial arts, coding also requires consistent practise to hone in the skill. As you move through the interview stages of the programme, you will most likely be sent tech tasks and/or coding “Katas" to complete for your take-home/live interviews. Test-Driven Development (TDD) is a sought after skill as an engineer in the tech industry, as it can help you write testable and clean code through a test-first approach. We call this ‘test-driving’ a program.
